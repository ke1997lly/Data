Bounded rationality

Bounded rationality is a concept that recognizes that people have limitations in their ability to process information and make decisions. These limitations include cognitive limitations (such as limited attention and memory), information constraints (such as incomplete or imperfect information), and environmental factors (such as time and resource constraints).
Because of these limitations, people are not able to fully analyze and evaluate all available options when making decisions. Instead, they rely on heuristics or shortcuts to simplify the decision-making process. These heuristics can be helpful in some situations, but they can also lead to biases and errors in judgment.
For example, people may use the availability heuristic, which involves making decisions based on the information that is most easily available to them. This can lead to biases if the available information is not representative of the overall situation.
Similarly, people may use the confirmation bias, which involves seeking out information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignoring information that contradicts them. This can lead to errors in judgment and prevent people from considering all available options.
Bounded rationality also suggests that people may not always choose the option that is objectively best in terms of the expected outcome. Instead, they may choose an option that is "good enough" given the constraints they face. This can lead to suboptimal outcomes, but it may be necessary in situations where time and resources are limited.
Overall, bounded rationality is an important concept in understanding how people make decisions and how their decision-making processes are influenced by cognitive, informational, and environmental factors.
